## Rainmeter skin

Setupping can be done in the "SpectralHex.ini" file.
There are a few options which can be adjusted. Actions and icons can be set in there too.
Skin contains six launchers, but user can add more of them by following instructions in the file.
Skin uses Windows default paths to music, videos, pictures and documents folder. These paths can be changed.
E.g change LeftMouseUpAction=["%userprofile%\documents"] to LeftMouseUpAction=["F:\Folders\Pictures"]
